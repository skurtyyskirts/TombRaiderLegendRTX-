# Vibe Reverse Engineering -- Claude Code Instructions

## Engineering Standards

Every change should make the codebase better, not just make the problem go away. If a solution needs a paragraph to justify why it's not a hack, it's a hack.

### Remove
- **Fixes in the wrong layer**: a guard on a canvas to suppress commits that a model should own. Put the fix where the problem originates.
- **Tolerance inflation**: widening deltas or adding retries to hide flaky behavior. If the value is wrong, find out why.
- **Catch-all exception swallowing**: `try/except Exception: pass` to hide symptoms.
- **Excessive error/null handling**: adding too many error/None "if" checks. If the error is expected, handle it. If unexpected, raise it.
- **God methods**: 200+ line functions doing multiple things. Break into named steps. Focus on cognitive load. Design for fewer indentation levels.
- **Leaky abstractions**: implementation details leaking into layers/modules that should be agnostic of one another.

### Design For
- **Single responsibility**: one component, one job. If you need "and" to describe it, split it.
- **Ownership**: the component that creates the problem owns the fix.
- **Minimal public surface**: expose what consumers need, nothing more.

### Commit to the New Code
- **No legacy fallbacks**: if you replace a system, remove the old one.
- **No dead code**: commented-out blocks, unused imports, orphan functions "just in case". Version control is the safety net.
- **No multiple paths to the same result**: one way to do each thing. If two paths exist, one is wrong.
- **No half-migrations**: finish the job -- update every reference, remove old APIs.

### Smell Tests
- "It works if I add a sleep" -- broken data flow.
- "It works if I read from widget instead of storage" -- the two are out of sync.
- "It passes alone but fails with other tests" -- shared mutable state leaking.
- "I added a flag to skip this code path" -- why does that path run in the first place?

## Code Comments

Each file reads as if it was always designed this way. Comments guide the next developer, not narrate the development journey.

### Remove
- **Implementation backstories**: "We do this because the other day X happened"
- **Obvious narration**: "Create the attribute", "Loop through keys", "Check if valid" -- if the code says it, the comment is noise
- **Debugging breadcrumbs**: "Without this, subsequent tests may see the modifier key as still held"
- **Trial-and-error reasoning**: "We tried X but it caused Y so we do Z instead"

### Keep
- **Non-obvious design decisions**: stated as *what* and *why this design*, not *what happened to us*
- **Tricky invariants**: conditions that would be easy to accidentally break
- **API contracts**: docstrings on public methods with Args, Returns, Raises

### Prefer Instead
- **Rename** a variable or function to be self-explanatory rather than adding a comment
- **Docstrings** on classes and public methods (Google style: `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`)
- **Type hints** over comments about expected types
- **Short inline comments** on the *why*, never the *what*

## Tool Catalog

All tools work on PE binaries (`.exe` and `.dll`). `$B` = path to binary, `$VA` = hex address, `$D` = path to minidump `.dmp` file. Check tools help command for more info on usage.
Always consult this catalog before making any move to take the best decision on what to use with best bang for your buck.

IMPORTANT: Collecting MORE INFORMATION per command run is encouraged over minor snippets of data/output that don't reveal the whole picture.

### D3D9 Frame Trace (`graphics/directx/dx9/tracer/`) -- full-frame API capture and analysis

A proxy DLL that intercepts all 119 `IDirect3DDevice9` methods, capturing every call with arguments, backtraces, pointer-followed data (matrices, constants, shader bytecodes), and in-process shader disassembly (via the game's own d3dx9 DLL). Outputs JSONL for offline analysis. Like `apitrace` but with RE-focused analysis built in.

**Architecture**: Python codegen (`d3d9_methods.py`) → C proxy DLL (`src/`) → JSONL → Python analyzer (`analyze.py`). The proxy chains to the real d3d9 (or another wrapper) and adds near-zero overhead when not capturing.

#### Setup and Capture

```
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer codegen -o d3d9_trace_hooks.inc   # regenerate C hooks
cd graphics/directx/dx9/tracer/src && build.bat                              # build proxy DLL
# Deploy d3d9.dll + proxy.ini to game directory
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer trigger --game-dir <GAME_DIR>     # trigger capture (3s countdown)
```

**proxy.ini** settings: `CaptureFrames=N`, `CaptureInit=1` (capture boot-time calls), `Chain.DLL=<wrapper.dll>` (or empty for system d3d9).

**IMPORTANT**: `--game-dir` must point to the directory containing the deployed proxy DLL.

### Tool Caveats

#### `rtti.py` -- MSVC RTTI only

Works exclusively with **MSVC-compiled** binaries that have RTTI enabled (`/GR`, the default). Will not work with GCC/Clang/MinGW binaries, binaries compiled with `/GR-`, or partially stripped binaries.

**How to get a vtable address:**
1. From `vtable.py dump $VA` -- if you already know a vtable location
2. From `datarefs.py` / `structrefs.py` -- field at offset `+0x00` of a C++ object is typically the vtable pointer
3. From live debugging -- `livetools mem read` on an object, the first pointer-sized value is the vtable

**`throwinfo` input differs by bitness:**
- 64-bit: pass the RVA from the exception record (minidump param[2] minus param[3])
- 32-bit: pass the absolute VA directly (minidump param[2])

#### `funcinfo.py` -- call-target heuristic

`find_start()` locates function boundaries by building a table of all `CALL`/`JMP` targets. This misses functions only reachable via indirect calls (vtable dispatch, callbacks, function pointers). If `funcinfo.py` returns a clearly wrong function start, use `disasm.py` and look for padding/prologues manually.

#### `datarefs.py` / `search.py strings --xrefs` -- addressing modes

These tools find references via absolute memory operands, immediate values (with `--imm` flag), and RIP-relative addressing. If you suspect a reference exists but the tool doesn't find it, the address might be computed at runtime. Try `search.py pattern` with the address bytes directly, or use `livetools memwatch`.

### Project Workspace

Use `patches/<project_name>/` (git-ignored) for all project-specific artifacts:
- Knowledge base files (`kb.h`)
- One-off analysis scripts
- ASI patch specs and builds
- Notes, logs, collected trace data

Create the project subfolder on first use.

### Knowledge Base

When reverse engineering a binary, maintain a knowledge base file (`.h`) that accumulates discoveries. Store in `patches/<project>/kb.h`.

**Format:**
```c
// C type definitions (structs, enums, typedefs) -- no prefix
struct Foo { int x; float y; };
enum Mode { MODE_A=0, MODE_B=1 };
typedef unsigned int Flags;

// Function signatures at addresses -- @ prefix
@ 0x401000 void __cdecl ProcessInput(int key);
@ 0x402000 float __thiscall Object_GetValue(Object* this);

// Global variables at addresses -- $ prefix
$ 0x7C5548 Object* g_mainObject
$ 0x7C554C Flags g_renderFlags
```

**When to update the KB:**
- When you identify a function's purpose, add `@ 0xADDR` with a descriptive name and signature
- When you reconstruct a struct (e.g., from `structrefs.py --aggregate`), add the struct definition
- When you identify a global variable via `datarefs.py`, add `$ 0xADDR` with its name and type
- When you identify magic constants, define an enum with named values
- When `rtti.py` reveals a class name, use it in struct/function names

**Always pass `--types <kb_file>` when using `decompiler.py`** so accumulated knowledge improves every decompilation.

## RTX Remix — DX9 FFP Porting

Some DX9 games use custom vertex shaders that RTX Remix cannot inject into because Remix requires fixed-function pipeline (FFP) geometry for path-traced lighting and replaceable assets. The FFP template (`rtx_remix_tools/dx/dx9_ffp_template/`) is a D3D9 proxy DLL that intercepts `IDirect3DDevice9`, captures the game's VS constant matrices (View/Projection/World), NULLs the shaders on draw calls, applies the matrices through `SetTransform`, and chain-loads RTX Remix. Each game requires its own RE investigation.

**When to use this workflow**: whenever the user mentions FFP rendering, DX9 shader-to-FFP conversion, RTX Remix compatibility, or building a `d3d9.dll` proxy for a game.

**SKINNING IS OFF BY DEFAULT.** Do NOT enable `ENABLE_SKINNING`, modify skinning code, or discuss skinning infrastructure unless the user explicitly asks for character model / bone / skeletal animation support.

### File Map

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `rtx_remix_tools/dx/dx9_ffp_template/proxy/d3d9_device.c` | Core FFP conversion — 119-method `IDirect3DDevice9` wrapper |
| `rtx_remix_tools/dx/dx9_ffp_template/proxy/d3d9_main.c` | DLL entry, logging, Remix chain-loading, INI parsing |
| `rtx_remix_tools/dx/dx9_ffp_template/proxy/d3d9_wrapper.c` | `IDirect3D9` wrapper — intercepts `CreateDevice` |
| `rtx_remix_tools/dx/dx9_ffp_template/proxy/proxy.ini` | Runtime config: Remix chain load, albedo texture stage |
| `rtx_remix_tools/dx/dx9_ffp_template/proxy/build.bat` | MSVC x86 no-CRT build (auto-finds VS via vswhere) |
| `extensions/skinning/README.md` | Guide for enabling skinning (late-stage only) |

Per-game copies live at `patches/<GameName>/` (copy the whole template directory).

### Analysis Scripts

| Script | What it surfaces |
|--------|-----------------|
| `scripts/find_d3d_calls.py <game.exe>` | D3D9/D3DX imports and call sites |
| `scripts/find_vs_constants.py <game.exe>` | `SetVertexShaderConstantF` call sites and register/count args |
| `scripts/find_device_calls.py <game.exe>` | Device vtable call patterns |
| `scripts/decode_vtx_decls.py <game.exe> --scan` | Vertex declaration formats |
| `scripts/scan_d3d_region.py <game.exe> 0xSTART 0xEND` | D3D9 vtable calls in a code region |

Scripts are fast first-pass scanners — always follow up with `retools` and `livetools` for deep analysis.

### Game-Specific Defines

The top of `proxy/d3d9_device.c` has a `GAME-SPECIFIC` section that must be set from RE findings:

```c
#define VS_REG_VIEW_START       0   // First register of view matrix
#define VS_REG_VIEW_END         4
#define VS_REG_PROJ_START       4   // First register of projection matrix
#define VS_REG_PROJ_END         8
#define VS_REG_WORLD_START     16   // First register of world matrix
#define VS_REG_WORLD_END       20
#define ENABLE_SKINNING         0   // Off by default; only set to 1 after rigid FFP works
```

### Porting Workflow

1. **Static analysis**: Run `find_d3d_calls.py`, `find_vs_constants.py`, `decode_vtx_decls.py`. Use `retools.decompiler` on `SetVertexShaderConstantF` call sites to identify matrix register layout.
2. **Dynamic confirmation**: Trace `SetVertexShaderConstantF` live:
   ```bash
   python -m livetools trace <call_addr> --count 50 \
       --read "[esp+8]:4:uint32; [esp+10]:4:uint32; *[esp+c]:64:float32"
   ```
   Captures: startRegister, Vector4fCount, and the actual float data (first 4 vec4 constants, dereferenced).
3. **Copy template**: `patches/<GameName>/` — update the `GAME-SPECIFIC` defines.
4. **Build**: `cd patches/<GameName>/proxy && build.bat`
5. **Deploy**: Copy `d3d9.dll` + `proxy.ini` to the game directory.
6. **Iterate via log**: The proxy writes `ffp_proxy.log` after a 50-second delay. Check VS regs written, vertex declarations, actual matrix values. Do not change the logging delay unless the user asks.

**Always tell the user when you need them to interact with the game** for logging or hooking purposes. They must be in-game with real geometry visible.

### Editing d3d9_device.c — What to Edit vs Leave Alone

| Section | Edit Per-Game? |
|---------|----------------|
| `VS_REG_*` and `ENABLE_SKINNING` defines | **YES** |
| `FFP_SetupLighting`, `FFP_SetupTextureStages`, `FFP_ApplyTransforms` | MAYBE |
| `WD_DrawPrimitive` / `WD_DrawIndexedPrimitive` | **YES** — draw routing |
| IUnknown + relay thunks | NO — naked ASM, never edit |
| Everything else | NO |

**DrawIndexedPrimitive routing**: no NORMAL → HUD passthrough; rigid with NORMAL → FFP convert; skinned → FFP skinned draw (only when `ENABLE_SKINNING=1`).

### Common Pitfalls

- **Wrong matrices**: D3D9 FFP expects row-major. Proxy transposes. If game stores row-major in VS constants, remove the transpose in `FFP_ApplyTransforms`.
- **White/black objects**: Albedo texture on stage 1+. Set `AlbedoStage` in `proxy.ini`, or trace `SetTexture` to find the right stage.
- **Geometry at origin**: World matrix register mapping wrong — re-check VS constant writes via `livetools trace`.
- **Game crashes on startup**: Set `Enabled=0` in `proxy.ini [Remix]` to test without Remix.
- **Missing world geometry**: Check whether its vertex decl has NORMAL and whether `viewProjValid` is true at draw time.
