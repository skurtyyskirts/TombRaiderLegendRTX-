# Engineering Standards

Every change should make the codebase better, not just make the problem go away. If a solution needs a paragraph to justify why it's not a hack, it's a hack.

## Remove

- **Fixes in the wrong layer**: a guard on a canvas to suppress commits that a model should own. Put the fix where the problem originates.
- **Tolerance inflation**: widening deltas or adding retries to hide flaky behavior. If the value is wrong, find out why.
- **Catch-all exception swallowing**: `try/except Exception: pass` to hide symptoms.
- **Excessive error/null handling**: adding too many error/None "if" checks. If the error is expected, handle it. If unexpected, raise it.
- **God methods**: 200+ line functions doing multiple things. Break into named steps. Focus on cognitive load. Design for fewer indentation levels.
- **Leaky abstractions**: implementation details leaking into layers/modules that should be agnostic of one another.

## Design For

- **Single responsibility**: one component, one job. If you need "and" to describe it, split it.
- **Ownership**: the component that creates the problem owns the fix.
- **Minimal public surface**: expose what consumers need, nothing more.

## Commit to the New Code

- **No legacy fallbacks**: if you replace a system, remove the old one.
- **No dead code**: commented-out blocks, unused imports, orphan functions "just in case". Version control is the safety net.
- **No multiple paths to the same result**: one way to do each thing. If two paths exist, one is wrong.
- **No half-migrations**: finish the job -- update every reference, remove old APIs.

## Smell Tests

- "It works if I add a sleep" -- broken data flow.
- "It works if I read from widget instead of storage" -- the two are out of sync.
- "It passes alone but fails with other tests" -- shared mutable state leaking.
- "I added a flag to skip this code path" -- why does that path run in the first place?

## Code Comments

Each file reads as if it was always designed this way. Comments guide the next developer, not narrate the development journey.

### Remove

- **Implementation backstories**: "We do this because the other day X happened"
- **Obvious narration**: "Create the attribute", "Loop through keys", "Check if valid" -- if the code says it, the comment is noise
- **Debugging breadcrumbs**: "Without this, subsequent tests may see the modifier key as still held"
- **Trial-and-error reasoning**: "We tried X but it caused Y so we do Z instead"

### Keep

- **Non-obvious design decisions**: stated as *what* and *why this design*, not *what happened to us*
- **Tricky invariants**: conditions that would be easy to accidentally break
- **API contracts**: docstrings on public methods with Args, Returns, Raises

### Prefer Instead

- **Rename** a variable or function to be self-explanatory rather than adding a comment
- **Docstrings** on classes and public methods (Google style: `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`)
- **Type hints** over comments about expected types
- **Short inline comments** on the *why*, never the *what*
